The production script in static/ will replace all files with their *_test* equivalent. THERE ARE NO BACKUPS, ALWAYS
MAKE SURE TEST FILES ARE NEWER THAN PRODUCTION.
     TODO - have script save production snapshot

Files named *_test.html in this folder are for experimentation, and should not be used to replace production files.
Their production equivalents will point to the production equivalent of any static files used. At the moment, changes
in the html must be reflected in both files.
     TODO - figure out a better way to manage this.
