    <span class="indent"></span>Hi, I'm Sam Pullman, and I like to write <a  href="https://github.com/sampullman">code</a>. I
have experience with the Android platform, and my <a  href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> describes some of the applications I've
worked on.  I'm also familiar with several web technologies; I built this website to learn Django, a python based web framework.
 I'm also interested in distributed systems, augmented reality, and game design.

    <span class="indent"></span>If you'd like to request a cover letter, commission an android application, or collaborate on a
project you can reach me <a href="mailto:sampullman@gmail.com">here</a>. My current <a  href="/resume/">resum&eacute;</a> is
available in html and pdf form.

		  Here's a simple breakout clone I wrote using the html5 canvas element. Click in the game to begin,
		  and use arrow keys to move left or right.

		  The blocks are icons of some technologies/platforms I'm familiar with. Destroying the UNIX blocks will
		  award another ball, and some blocks will change the size of the ball that hits it.
		  Clear the blocks to face the boss!
